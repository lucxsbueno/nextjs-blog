# How to Clean Up npm and Migrate to Yarn

Sometimes during development, we might accidentally mix package managers in a project. This can happen when running `npm install` in a project that's already using Yarn, or vice versa. In this article, I'll show you how to clean up this situation and ensure your project uses only one package manager.

## The Problem

When you have files from both package managers (`package-lock.json` from npm and `yarn.lock` from Yarn) in the same project, it can cause:

- Dependency conflicts
- Deployment issues (especially on Vercel)
- Development environment inconsistencies
- Confusion for other developers

## The Solution

I'll show you the step-by-step process to clean up the project and migrate to Yarn:

### 1. Remove npm Files

First, we need to remove the npm-specific files:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
```

This command removes:

- The `node_modules` folder (which will be reinstalled)
- The `package-lock.json` file (npm-specific)

### 2. Reinstall Dependencies with Yarn

Now, let's reinstall all dependencies using Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

This command will:

- Read the `package.json`
- Install all dependencies
- Generate a clean new `yarn.lock`

### 3. Commit Changes

After cleaning up, it's important to commit the changes to Git:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "chore: remove npm files and reinstall dependencies with yarn"
```

### 4. Push to Repository

Finally, send the changes to the remote repository:

```bash
git push
```

## Benefits of Migration

By using only Yarn, you'll have:

- Consistent dependency management
- Better deployment performance
- Avoid conflicts between different package managers
- Clearer documentation for other developers

## Useful Yarn Commands

Here are some common Yarn commands you can use:

- `yarn add [package]` - Install a new dependency
- `yarn remove [package]` - Remove a dependency
- `yarn dev` - Run the project in development mode
- `yarn build` - Create production build
- `yarn test` - Run tests

## Conclusion

Maintaining a project using only one package manager is a good development practice. It avoids compatibility issues and makes the project easier to maintain. If you're already using Yarn, stay committed to it and avoid mixing with npm.

Remember: consistency is the key to smoother development and more reliable deployments.
