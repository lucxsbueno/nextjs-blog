# How to Handle Cascading Deletes in Prisma and Avoid Foreign Key Errors

In many applications, we have relationships between tables that are enforced by foreign keys. When you need to delete a record, these relationships can lead to errors if not handled properly. In this article, I'll show you how to deal with cascading deletes in Prisma, especially when deleting a record that has foreign key constraints.

## The Problem

Imagine you have a `User` table and a `Post` table, where each post references a user via a foreign key (`userId`). If `userId` is required (i.e., it's not nullable), and you try to delete a user without properly handling the posts that reference them, you'll encounter errors due to the foreign key constraint.

The main issues that can occur are:

- Foreign key constraint violations when attempting to delete the user
- Confusion about how to remove related records (posts) without breaking the database
- Potential data integrity issues if related records aren't handled properly

## The Solution

To resolve these issues, you need to either configure cascading deletes or manually handle the deletion of related records. Here's how you can do both:

### 1. Use `onDelete: Cascade` in Prisma Schema

The easiest way to handle cascading deletes is to configure the foreign key relationship with the `onDelete: Cascade` option. This ensures that when a user is deleted, all posts associated with them are deleted automatically.

In your `schema.prisma`, define the relation like this:

```prisma
model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String
  email String  @unique
  posts Post[]
}

model Post {
  id     Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  title  String
  userId Int
  user   User   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
}
```

With `onDelete: Cascade`, Prisma will automatically delete all related posts when a user is deleted.

### 2. Manual Deletion of Related Posts

If you don't want to use `onDelete: Cascade`, you need to handle the deletion of related posts manually. The first step is to update the `userId` in the `Post` table to avoid foreign key violations. You can either set `userId` to `NULL` (if your schema allows it) or assign it a default value (e.g., a "guest" user).

#### A) Update `userId` to `NULL` (if allowed)

```javascript
await prisma.post.updateMany({
  where: {
    userId: userId,  // ID of the user to be deleted
  },
  data: {
    userId: null,  // Remove the reference to the user
  },
});
```

#### B) Assign a Default User to Posts

If `userId` is required and cannot be set to `NULL`, you may need to assign a default user (e.g., a "guest" user) to the posts:

```javascript
const anonymousUser = await prisma.user.upsert({
  where: { email: 'anonimo@example.com' },
  create: { email: 'anonimo@example.com', name: 'Anônimo' },
  update: {},
});

await prisma.post.updateMany({
  where: {
    userId: userId,  // ID of the user to be deleted
  },
  data: {
    userId: anonymousUser.id,  // Assign the default user
  },
});
```

### 3. Delete the User

After updating the posts to avoid foreign key violations, you can safely delete the user:

```javascript
await prisma.user.delete({
  where: {
    id: userId,
  },
});
```

### 4. Commit the Changes

Finally, don’t forget to commit these changes to Git and push them to your repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "chore: handle cascading deletes and update related posts before deleting user"
git push
```

## Benefits of Handling Cascading Deletes Properly

By handling cascading deletes or manually updating related records, you'll benefit from:

- **Avoiding foreign key errors** when deleting records
- **Maintaining data integrity** by ensuring that related records are properly handled
- **Clearer application logic**, as developers will know exactly how related data is managed during deletions

## Conclusion

Managing cascading deletes and foreign key constraints in Prisma can be a bit tricky, especially when you're dealing with required foreign key fields. By either using `onDelete: Cascade` or manually handling related records, you can ensure that your database remains consistent and your application runs smoothly.

Remember: whether you choose automatic cascading deletes or handle it manually, the key is to avoid foreign key constraint violations and maintain the integrity of your data.
